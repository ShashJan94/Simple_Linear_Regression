# Simple_Linear_Regression
Regression starts off with simplicity and the lines suddenly take a turn! The project directory will be 
Examples of univariate simple linear regression methods. 
The examples are covered in Python. 
To execute a regression model statistical formulas are needed. 
Python has built in functions for performing the regression analysis. The formulas are incorporated.
Though Python has all the features and the facilities to offer to complete an analysis, the formulas in the projects are created from the scratch again. This may help and motivate the curious learners to understand the mathematical operations happening on the background and develop their own functions. The algorithmic procedure behind a mathematical function will be elaborated.
All the examples are done based on OLS method. 
Five projects will get uploaded serially. For those five projects open-source data files are used. 
Correction minimality is not a requirement while peforming the analysis rather implementation comfortability is encouraged. 
Tools used for completing the examples: 
   1. Conda
   2. Jupyter Lab
   3. Jupyter Notebook
   4. Python Libraries
Datasets:
   1. Diamond.csv
   2. Boston.csv
In every notebook, mathematical operations included inside a model will be discussed elaborately. Such as Derivatives, Statistical Terms, Linear Algebra Matrix Operations and some Trig functions; These are the basic maths related to machine learning. Learners struggles a lot to understand the maths behind machine learning. The primary idea is to show the practical application of mathematical formulas on the applied field. To simply put- the abstract nature of solving equations and the application of the equations on real life problems are treated seperatedly in most of the learning playgrounds. A proper and well balanced documentation is needed for basic guidance.
